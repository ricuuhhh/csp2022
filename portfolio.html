    <h1>   This project, named "Snowman Explosion", consisted of Frosty the Snowman being built into a grassy terrain and immediately hit by a meteor. This meteor explodes Frosty into three pieces, while sending him into space. In space, he floates over to Mars, where, because of the lack of an atmosphere, melts.

We make the little kids do math and it is basically a calculator that supports them with the awnser and once they get an awnser write there is the girl from the minion movie dancing pops up.

    <h1>   This project is our first scratch project and it is called monkee. It is a game where we have our main character which is a monkee, and the goal is to catch all of the bananas that are falling from the sky. But there is a little twist, there is also a hedgehog falling from the sky and if the monkee eats that hedgehog the game will be over. After every 60 points you get, the monkee will appear in a new setting.</h1>
    <h1>  3.16 Project</h1>

    <h1> We learned that there are four sensors that take temperature, sound, light and movement. The data is put into a continuous stream and it is up to us to sort it and match it to our environment.We can see where the data points have a huge difference and then filter it there
We can filter it by decimal places and ranges as well. We can then make graphs of each data set and match them to our estimated graphs.
